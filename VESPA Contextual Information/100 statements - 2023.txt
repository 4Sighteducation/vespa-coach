Vision 
 
1. I have ‘personal bests’ I’m trying to beat when I submit new work

Effort 
 
1. I can increase periods of concentration if I have to – I know what my main distractions are, and how to turn them off so I can focus 

2. I challenge myself when studying topics which I am not familiar with, working harder to understand them and revisiting them for checks more often 

3. I complete draft-work in advance and ask the teacher to take a quick look at it so I can make any changes before the real deadline

10. I often go looking for problems – seeking out topics I find hard and listing the questions I want to discuss with my teacher 

11. I often go the extra mile to complete work to a really high standard, asking myself ‘what would this look like if it were excellent?’ 

12. I often try to see the value in the work my teachers set, and explain to myself why it’s important, even if I sometimes have to persuade myself 

13. I often work without screens, headphones or alerts, switching everything off so it’s just me and the task

Systems 
 
1. I can breakdown in small steps what I need to achieve, and often do things in more than one sitting rather than all at once

8. I look ahead to next week, checking what needs doing so that even when lots of deadlines come at once, I work out how to finish and submit everything 

9. I make mini-lists of tasks I have to do at the start of particular periods – like on a Monday, or over a weekend – and think about how to prioritise them 

10. I might set reminders for myself – alarms on my phone – or leave notes for myself so I don’t forget things

17. I sometimes plan my week in advance, giving myself plenty of time to work on tasks 

18. I sometimes summarise everything we’ve learnt on one page, or a series of flash-cards, or a knowledge organiser

Practice 
 
1. I am not afraid to give a question a go, even if I am not fully sure the method I use on my first attempt will be a success 

2. I analyse where I have gone wrong on exam or test questions by going through the feedback or checking a mark scheme 

3. I collect exam questions and organise them into groups: topic-by-topic or easy-medium-hard 

4. I do past paper questions, often for short intense bursts, dipping in and out like mini-exams 

5. I have a go at making my own exam style questions and marking my answers 

6. I have identified my weaker areas of understanding and focused more time on these areas 

7. I know how long each exam is and I am driven to know how long I will need to spend on each section. I time myself on each section to try to work this out 

8. I know the different command words to expect in a test or exam and have listed them so I can revise each one 

9. I know the skills required in exams and tests, often I’ve practised using a range of unfamiliar data, photos, graphs, maps, questions etc so it doesn’t matter if the wording is different on the day or examples are unfamiliar 

10. I know what I need to do with my notes in order to make them fit for retrieval/revision, and I spend time regularly checking I can recall them 

11. I like looking at model answers to understand how to reach the top of the mark scheme 

12. I often lecture my notes out loud from memory as if I were teaching a class, to practice the kind of explanation the exam will require of me 

13. I re-use past paper questions, sometimes over and over, until I’m confident 

14. I seek out additional exam questions and mark schemes, even if they are from different exam boards 

15. I set myself timed questions and work under exam conditions even when I don’t feel like it 

16. I sometimes submit extra work for marking to ensure my teacher gives me a clear steer on how to improve 

17. I sometimes try and ‘think like an examiner’ – imagining what possible questions might come up for a topic and listing them all 

18. I will find opportunities to test myself on the knowledge I have gained by covering up information and trying to recall it 

19.If there are gaps in my knowledge, I know it’s my job to find out how to fill them 

20. When I revise with my friends, we test each other rather than just copy each other’s notes 


 
 
 
 
 
 
Attitude 
 
1. I allow myself time to be disappointed if something hasn’t gone as well as I hoped, but I can move forward and make a list of what I need to improve 

2. I can allow myself to be proud of what I have achieved, making a note of good news so I can return to it when I’m feeling less positive 

3. I don’t allow negative thoughts to dominate, I try to express them in a more positive way; ‘one thing this teaches me is…’ or ‘I know now that next time I need to…’ or ‘mistakes give me information on how to improve’  

4. I expect to have setbacks, they are part of my learning process. I try and take responsibility for them rather than blame everyone else 

5. I find a group with students who are currently performing better than I am, as it gives me a chance to challenge myself when I try to match or beat them 

6. I generally focus on written feedback rather than the mark or grade alone 

7. I generally keep trying on topics or questions I find hard, knowing that the longer I persist, the more likely I will succeed 

8. I have some tactics I use if I am feeling demotivated - go for a run, walk my dog, visit my friend, take a break 

9. I know constructive feedback is not an attack on my personality and this helps me action it rather than ignore it 

10. I know mistakes are information. I will give challenging work a go and try not to be afraid of making errors 

11. I know that sometimes, feedback is a reflection on my levels of effort or concentration… If I have to, I will accept I need to do more 

12. I read teacher feedback carefully and use this to re-draft work if I am unhappy with the grade 

13. I see my peers’ strengths as an opportunity to learn from them, for example by asking to revise as a pair, swapping notes or checking someone else’s work 

14. I seek help and support from peers and teachers when needed – I don’t feel this is a sign of weakness 

15. I sometimes force myself to be positive, for example by listing three good things that have recently happened 

16. I try and be positive, help others be positive, and choose positive friends. When friends get overly negative I either tell them, or take a break from them 

17. I try not to feel embarrassed when I am praised, but accept the praise and reflect on why it was given 

18. I use caring language and growth mindset to think about and discuss my learning; even when things have been hard I try not to criticise myself 

19. When I improve a score or mark, I take time to recognise what I did to achieve it – perhaps making a note so I can make sure I repeat my success 

20. When I need to, I know I can focus on how far I’ve come and reassure myself that I’m making progress
