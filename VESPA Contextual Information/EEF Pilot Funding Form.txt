The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal supports students preparing for GCSE resits by offering targeted, intensive interventions before the November and May exams. Using the VESPA Questionnaire, we identify key non-cognitive study behaviours that signal exam risk in Year 11 and Post 16 resit students. Those identified receive personalized coaching with tailored study plans and revision strategies. The portal also assesses socio-emotional factors such as Vision and Attitude, which reflect future-mindedness, academic buoyancy, and a growth mindset—areas often lower in students lacking the cultural capital of more economically advantaged students. Our bespoke student reports promote reflection and dialogue, enabling staff to address these issues early, helping to develop self-confidence and reduce exam stress. This balanced approach strengthens both academic skills and emotional resilience, while our framework ensures continuous support from school through to Post 16 providers..

3.9 Please provide a brief, two sentence summary of your programme(max 50 words)  
The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal is an interactive, research-driven tool that diagnoses five key non-cognitive behaviours (Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude). Through personalised reports, targeted interventions, and dashboards, it provides structured feedback to students and tutors, improving study habits and attainment for post-16 learners, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
3.10 Please describe your programme, including the specific activities that settings, practitioners, and pupils will be expected to do, and the support and/or training that you will provide to ensure effective implementation (max 400 words)  
The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal is an interactive, research-driven platform designed to enhance non-cognitive study behaviours in post-16 students. The programme operates on multiple levels, engaging pupils, practitioners, and settings through a series of structured activities and comprehensive support measures.
For Pupils:  VESPA Questionnaire: Students begin by completing an assessment that measures five key non-cognitive study behaviours: Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude.
Personalised Coaching Report: Based on the assessment, each student receives a tailored report that includes a score out of 10 for each element, detailed feedback, reflective goal-setting sections, and targeted coaching questions to guide subsequent discussions with tutors.VESPA Activities: Students are offered two recommended activities per element, designed to address areas of weakness and promote the development of effective study habits.
For Practitioners and Settings:  Teacher Dashboard: Educators access a dedicated dashboard where they can view individual and cohort-wide results, adjust activities based on student progress, and access resources such as interactive slide decks and activity PDFs.Targeted Interventions: For students identified as at risk of failing, the system recommends additional study strategies and intensive coaching sessions, ensuring prompt and effective support.
Support and Training:  Initial Training: Teachers and tutors participate in comprehensive training sessions that cover report interpretation, effective use of the dashboard, and implementation of targeted interventions. These sessions are delivered both in person and online, incorporating hands-on workshops and interactive demonstrations.Ongoing Support: The programme provides continuous support through regular webinars, a dedicated help desk, and an online community where educators can share best practices and troubleshoot challenges together.
Implementation Timeline:  The programme is initially launched as a 6–12 month pilot or efficacy trial, allowing for evaluation and iterative improvements. Following positive evaluation outcomes, a multi-year scale-up is planned to ensure sustained, measurable improvements in student study behaviours and academic attainment.Overall, the VESPA Academy Coaching Portal offers a comprehensive, data-driven approach that equips students with both the academic skills and emotional resilience needed for success, while providing educators with the tools and support necessary to deliver high-quality, tailored interventions.


3.11 Do you need to make any further adaptions to your programme before it is evaluated?  Generally, at Pilot stage we would expect minimal adaptions to the programme to be required (applicants should be applying with fully developed programmes). In limited circumstances, we may offer some pre-pilot developmental support to programmes, see the guidance notes for examples for where this might apply. Please describe here if any modifications need to be made to your programme before evaluation and if you would like to be considered for pre-pilot development support from EEF to make these modifications to your programme. (max 100 words) 
None, the programme is currently being used successfully in schools across the UK and beyond.
3.12 Please describe how your programme aligns with the EEF’s mission to break the link between family income and educational achievement (max 200 words) 
The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal is purpose-built to break the cycle between socio-economic disadvantage and academic underachievement. Extensive research highlights that non-cognitive skills—such as effort, motivation, and study organisation—are critical predictors of success, yet many disadvantaged students lack the structured support needed to develop these skills. Our platform delivers targeted, evidence-based interventions that directly improve study habits while empowering tutors with structured coaching tools. By leveraging the validated VESPA Questionnaire, the portal provides personalised coaching reports and tailored activities that help students build independent study skills essential for further education and employment. This approach not only enhances immediate academic performance but also fosters long-term self-regulation and resilience. In addressing the study behaviour gap, our programme directly contributes to the EEF’s mission of reducing educational disparities and ensuring that every student, regardless of family income, has the opportunity to succeed academically. Furthermore, the portal integrates continuous progress monitoring and real-time feedback, enabling educators to dynamically adjust strategies. Its scalable design supports widespread adoption across diverse educational settings and cultivates a community of practice that shares and refines best teaching approaches, ensuring sustained support for students facing socio-economic challenges.
3.13 Please describe how your proposed programme contributes to the evidence base, and/or will address sector interests (max 200 words).  
Our programme builds on a strong evidence base that underscores the critical role of self-regulated learning and non-cognitive skills in academic success (Zimmerman, 2002), alongside research demonstrating that academic coaching can significantly improve student retention and performance (Bettinger & Baker, 2014). Digital feedback systems have also been shown to enhance learner engagement and outcomes (EEF, 2021), reinforcing the potential impact of our approach.
The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal contributes to this evidence base by using the validated VESPA Questionnaire to assess key study behaviours, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement. This assessment forms the cornerstone of our theory of change, which emphasizes student self-awareness as the first step towards targeted intervention. Personalized coaching reports and bespoke activities then guide students to enhance their motivation, organisation, and effort. Structured, mentor-led support ensures that interventions are effectively implemented, driving improved study habits that translate into better exam performance.
By addressing these non-cognitive factors, our programme not only aligns with sector interests in evidence-based, digital interventions but also bridges the gap between academic research and classroom practice, ultimately fostering sustainable academic growth and resilience across diverse learner populations.
3.14 Please outline any training and implementation commitments for teachers and/or settings taking part in your programme (max 100 words).   
Teachers and settings will receive comprehensive initial training delivered both in-person and online. This training covers report interpretation, effective use of the teacher dashboard, and tailored intervention strategies. Ongoing support is provided through regular webinars, a dedicated help desk, and an online community for sharing best practices. Continuous refresher sessions and feedback loops ensure that staff remain proficient and engaged, enabling them to maximise the platform’s impact on student outcomes.
3.15 Please include an indicative budget for a Pilot with 20 settings, broken down into the direct cost per setting and central costs for managing the project (max 100 words)
For a 20-setting pilot, direct costs per setting are estimated at approximately £3,000. This includes platform costs at £15 per student for 100 students (£1,500) and an estimated £1,500 covering delivery, time, and travel expenses per setting. Central costs for managing the project, including programme management, administration, and £10,000 for printing physical booklets, are estimated at around £25,000. In total, the pilot budget would be approximately £85,000, ensuring the programme remains affordable for disadvantaged schools while delivering robust support and training.
3.16 Please describe how your proposed programme is likely to be different from ‘business as usual’ in settings (max 100 words)
Our programme introduces a digital approach that transforms traditional support. Instead of staff making instinctive assessments of their students’ current study strategies, then offering generic advice for improvement (‘organise your notes’, ‘work harder’), the VESPA platform uses questionnaire data to provide tailored, real-time coaching, with powerful follow-up questions and online resources that provide replicable, effective tools and strategies. Teachers access an interactive dashboard to adjust interventions for each student, addressing both academic and socio-emotional challenges. This proactive, personalised model moves away from one-size-fits-all strategies, ensuring that support is responsive and aligned with every student’s unique needs.
3.17 Please outline how many settings the programme has been delivered in, to date, and how many of those were in England (max 100 words) 
Since launching in 2017, our programme has reached over 600 schools globally. Approximately 500 are in England, with expanding international reach across UAE, Australia, Malawi, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, South Africa and Portugal, demonstrating the programme's universal appeal. This extensive engagement demonstrates our ability to scale and adapt our evidence-based approach across diverse educational settings. Our collaborative work with local education authorities and individual schools has refined our model to better meet the needs of teachers and students. The broad uptake in England highlights the value and effectiveness of our interventions in supporting academic and socio-emotional development.
3.18 How many settings has the programme been delivered to in the last year? 
190
3.19 Please describe any feedback you’ve collected from settings and teachers that have participated in the programme, including information about how achievable implementation has been (max 100 words)
Feedback from schools using the VESPA Academy Portal has been overwhelmingly positive. Teachers report that the portal provides immediate, actionable feedback to learners, helping them identify strengths and areas for improvement. Pupils actively engage with tailored activities and one-to-one mentoring, resulting in improved study habits and exam performance, especially among socio-economically disadvantaged students. Educators note that the coaching element fosters accountability and resilience, with many citing enhanced organisational skills and increased academic engagement. Comprehensive training, ongoing support, and an intuitive dashboard have made implementation smooth and effective in challenging settings, affirming the platform’s significant impact on student outcome. (Additional Information)
3.20 Please describe any potential barriers to successful delivery, including how they have been, or could be, mitigated (max 100 words)
Potential barriers include resistance to change from staff, limited technical infrastructure in some settings, and time constraints for training and implementation. To mitigate these challenges, we provide comprehensive initial training, ongoing support via webinars and a dedicated help desk, and an intuitive platform that integrates smoothly with existing systems. Early engagement with school leadership fosters buy-in and addresses concerns proactively. Continuous feedback loops allow us to refine our approach, ensuring that both educators and students are fully supported throughout the rollout.
3.21 If the proposed programme were to be funded by the EEF, and positive results were found, would your organisation be able to develop the capacity to deliver the programme for an EEF funded impact evaluation, likely in around 50 settings? This would likely be a randomised controlled trial (max 50 words)
Yes, our organisation can scale to 50 settings if funded by the EEF. We have delivered the programme in over 600 schools, and our experienced team is ready to expand delivery. With robust training, technical support, and established infrastructure, we are equipped to conduct a randomised controlled trial impact evaluation.
3.22 If the answer to the question above is no, would you be willing to work with EEF to develop routes to scale? E.g. through finding a partner organisation to support delivery at scale (max 50 words)
3.23 Please briefly outline any potential barriers you anticipate in scaling the programme to other settings (max 50 words) 
Our main barrier is our small team size relative to growing demand. To address this, we plan to expand our team while integrating AI tools to extend our reach and capability. This combined approach allows us to provide consistent support across diverse school settings without compromising quality while scaling efficiently.
3.24 Please provide an explanation of the research evidence that supports the theory that your programme will work. You may provide references. Please also include information from any previous evaluations (max 200 words)
VESPA research demonstrates significant effectiveness across diverse educational settings. The model's core components (Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude) provide a structured framework for non-cognitive skill development that complements academic instruction.
Central South Consortium in Wales implemented VESPA across multiple schools, resulting in a 7.5% increase in A*-A Level grades. This improvement was directly attributed to VESPA's bespoke psychometric assessments and targeted intervention activities (Central South Consortium, 2021).
The University of Pretoria utilized VESPA to tailor student support programs, achieving a 4.45/5 student satisfaction score and improved retention rates. Hartpury University integrated VESPA into its learning strategy, documenting measurable improvements in student performance metrics and engagement levels.
Neath Port Talbot Colleges Group successfully implemented VESPA for pastoral care, with quantitative and qualitative student feedback demonstrating positive impacts of systems-focused activities on organisation and self-regulation (OTLA-6, Project 4B, 2020).
Dubai College employed VESPA to enhance study habits, recognising its impact beyond intelligence on academic outcomes. Independent research projects indicate VESPA's positive influence on effort allocation and study strategies, particularly among Year 12 students (Nelson & Colne/Runshaw College, 2022).
Evidence consistently shows VESPA's effectiveness in identifying student needs, improving academic behaviors, and fostering growth mindset across varied educational contexts.

3.25 Please outline how you think the implementation of your programme leads to behaviour change in staff/settings/parents/pupils as appropriate. If you have a theory of change or logic model, please feel free to upload it, but we don’t expect you to write one for the application.   (max 300 words) 
The VESPA model transforms how educational stakeholders approach student development by focusing on five key non-cognitive domains: Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude. This framework creates systematic behaviour change across multiple levels:
For students, the VESPA framework provides explicit awareness of their learning behaviors and metacognitive processes. This self-knowledge empowers them to take greater ownership of their educational journey, moving from passive recipients to active participants who understand how specific behaviors impact outcomes. Students develop self-regulation skills and a growth mindset that extends beyond academic contexts. Our psychometric assessment helps students identify strengths and areas for development, creating personalised improvement pathways that foster intrinsic motivation and metacognitive awareness.
For teaching staff, VESPA shifts attention away from fixed notions of 'ability' towards learnable study behaviours. Teachers gain a structured lens to assess students' behaviors and a shared language that catalyses changes in thinking. This develops school culture away from micromanagement towards frameworked independence and metacognitive approaches. The model provides teachers with concrete intervention strategies aligned to specific VESPA domains, enabling more precise and effective support for struggling students.
Comprehensive training on interpreting psychometric reports equips staff with evidence-based strategies tailored to each student's profile. The platform's data-driven insights enable teachers to transform routine mentoring into targeted coaching sessions addressing specific VESPA domains. The reports provide immediate insights and actionable solutions, enhancing teacher effectiveness while driving a cultural shift towards reflective practice and collaborative problem-solving.
Educational settings benefit from the ability to monitor metacognitive development..  This visibility supports informed decision-making, facilitating early interventions where needed and allowing for systematic approaches to non-cognitive skill development throughout the school.
Parents receive clearer communication about their child's development beyond grades. This structured feedback enhances home-school partnerships and creates consistency between environments, amplifying intervention impact and engaging families as active partners in supporting non-cognitive skill development.
