Is there a significant difference in responses to Vision-related questions compared to Practice-related questions?
What percentage of students agree or strongly agree with the growth mindset statement: "No matter who you are, you can change your intelligence" (Q5)?
Which individual questions within the Attitude theme have the highest and lowest average scores?
Are students who focus on effective revision strategies (e.g., Q7 and Q25) also confident in their ability to handle academic pressure (e.g., Q20)?
How does the sentiment about long-term planning (e.g., Q1 and Q3) relate to students' confidence and coping mechanisms (e.g., Q20 and Q28)?
What proportion of students demonstrate a balance between academic effort and self-perception as hard-working (e.g., Q9 and Q21)?
Do students who report high confidence in academic ability (Q10) also indicate strong organizational skills (Q22) or effective study habits (Q6)?
Is there a significant difference in responses between questions related to self-perception (e.g., Q9, Q8) and questions related to external practices like revision techniques (e.g., Q7, Q25)?
How do responses to questions about managing pressure (e.g., Q20, Q28) vary across the different themes (e.g., Vision vs. Effort)?
Are there any gender or demographic trends in responses, if such data is available, particularly in themes like Attitude or Practice?
Which themes or specific questions show the highest variability in responses, indicating a range of perspectives among students?
Are there any patterns in how students perceive the importance of education (Q29) in relation to their effort levels (e.g., Q6, Q21)?
Do students who frequently engage in self-testing (Q7) report higher levels of confidence in their academic ability (Q10)?

Are students in your dataset more or less likely than the national average to report effective use of study time (Q6)?
In which areas (themes or specific questions) do your students exceed national benchmarks, and where do they fall short?
What percentage of students in your data report high agreement (scores 4-5) on questions about planning and organization (Q2, Q22), and how does this compare to national statistics?
Are there significant differences between your students' reported ability to handle academic pressure (Q20, Q28) and the national benchmark for these questions?
