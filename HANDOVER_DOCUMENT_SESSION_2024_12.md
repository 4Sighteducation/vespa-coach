## 1. UI/UX Improvements

### 1.1 Text Size Controls
- **Added**: Text zoom functionality (50% - 150%) with persistent storage
- **Location**: `aiCoachLauncher2t.js` - `createTextSizeControls()` function
- **Features**:
  - Zoom buttons (+/-) in the header
  - Current zoom percentage indicator
  - Applies to both main panel and modals
  - Saves preference to localStorage

### 1.2 VESPA Color Theming

  - Vision: `#ff8f00` (orange)
  - Effort: `#86b4f0` (light blue)
  - Systems: `#72cb44` (green)
  - Practice: `#7f31a4` (purple)
  - Attitude: `#f032e6` (pink)
- **Applied to**: Problem selector categories, buttons, and UI elements

### 1.3 Window Size Adjustment
- **Changed**: Maximum draggable window width from 800px to 1200px
- **Location**: CSS variable `--ai-coach-panel-max-width` and resize handler
- **Minimum width**: Remains at 300px

### 1.4 Enhanced Visual Design
- **Improved borders**: Clearer visual separation with enhanced border styles
- **Chat differentiation**: 
  - User messages: Right-aligned with blue background
  - AI messages: Left-aligned with light gray background
- **Font sizes**: Increased base font sizes for better readability
- **Modal styling**: Enhanced modal designs with better spacing and borders

### 1.5 Problem Selector as Modal

  - Color-coded VESPA categories
  - Smooth animations
  - Better mobile responsiveness

### 1.6 Thinking Indicator Enhancement

  - Appears in chat stream for better visibility
  - Automatically removed when response arrives
  - Blue background to distinguish from regular messages

## 2. Backend Improvements

### 2.1 Welsh Language Activity Filter
- **Issue**: Welsh language activities (e.g., "E1-Y Raddfa 1–10") were appearing in suggestions
- **Solution**: Added filter in `app.py` to detect and exclude Welsh activities
- **Detection patterns**:
  - Welsh prefixes: '-Y ', 'Y ', 'Yr '
  - Welsh words: 'ddim', 'aeth', 'raddfa'
  - Welsh characters: 'ô', 'â', 'ê', 'î', 'û', 'ŵ', 'ŷ'
- **Location**: `chat_turn()` function, VESPA activities search section

### 2.2 Enhanced VESPA Element Detection
- **Added**: Smart detection of VESPA elements from problem descriptions
- **Example**: "Student doesn't review or practice regularly (Practice related)" → Prioritizes Practice activities
- **Implementation**: 
  - Detects element from parenthetical descriptions
  - Prioritizes activities from the mentioned element
  - Still includes complementary activities from other elements

### 2.3 Improved AI Tone and Conversational Style
- **Changed**: System prompt from formal/instructional to peer-to-peer conversational
- **Key changes**:
  - Speaks as a colleague, not an expert
  - No bullet points or formal structures
  - Natural activity mentions (e.g., "Have you tried the Growth Mindset activity?")
  - No IDs or technical formatting
  - Supportive, collaborative tone
- **Result**: More natural, less patronizing responses

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1 CSS Custom Properties Added
```css
--vespa-vision-color: #ff8f00;
--vespa-effort-color: #86b4f0;
--vespa-systems-color: #72cb44;
--vespa-practice-color: #7f31a4;
--vespa-attitude-color: #f032e6;
--ai-coach-panel-max-width: 1200px;
```

### 4.2 New Functions Added
- `createTextSizeControls()` - Manages text zoom
- `applyTextZoom()` - Applies zoom to all relevant elements
- Welsh filter logic in VESPA activities loop

### 4.3 Storage Keys
- `aiCoachTextZoom` - Stores user's preferred text zoom level (50-150)

---

## 5. Testing Notes

### What to Test:
1. **Text Zoom**: Check that zoom persists across sessions and applies to modals
2. **Welsh Filter**: Verify no Welsh activities appear in suggestions
3. **Conversational Tone**: Confirm AI responses are natural and peer-like
4. **Window Resize**: Test dragging to 1200px width
5. **Problem Modal**: Ensure smooth operation and VESPA colors
6. **Thinking Indicator**: Verify it appears/disappears correctly

### Known Considerations:
- The thinking indicator uses temporary DOM manipulation
- Welsh detection is pattern-based and may need refinement
- Text zoom affects all text elements uniformly

---

## 6. Deployment Notes

All changes are ready for deployment to Heroku:
- Python syntax has been verified
- No new dependencies added
- All changes are backward compatible
- Frontend changes will take effect immediately
- Backend changes require Heroku restart

---

## 7. Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
1. More sophisticated Welsh/language detection
2. Activity recommendation weighting system
3. Enhanced thinking indicator with progress stages
4. Customizable VESPA colors per school
5. More granular text size controls

### Technical Debt:
- Consider refactoring the modal system for consistency
- Evaluate moving hardcoded Welsh patterns to configuration
- Consider caching strategy for activity filtering
